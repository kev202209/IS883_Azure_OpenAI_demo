Taylor Swift,tiedtogetherwithasmile,"Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty Is the face in the mirror looking back at you You walk around here thinking you're not pretty But that's not true, 'cause I know you  Hold on baby, you're losing it The water's high, you're jumping into it And letting go and no one knows  That you cry but you don't tell anyone That you might not be the golden one And you're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone  I guess it's true that love was all you wanted 'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change Hoping it will end up in his pocket But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain  Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay Not his price to pay  Hold on baby, you're losing it The water's high, you're jumping into it And letting go and no one knows  That you cry but you don't tell anyone That you might not be the golden one And you're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone  Hold on baby, you're losing it The water's high, you're jumping into it And letting go and no one knows  That you cry but you don't tell anyone That you might not be the golden one And you're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone  You're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone  Goodbye, baby With a smile, baby, baby"
Taylor Swift,lastchristmas,"Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day, you gave it away  This year, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special Once bitten and twice shied I keep my distance but you still catch my eye Tell me baby Do you recognize me Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me Merry Christmas,  I wrapped it up and sent it With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it Now I know what a fool I've been  But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again Last Christmas I gave you my heart  But the very next day, you gave it away This year, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day, you gave it away  This year, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special A crowded room and friends with tired eyes I'm hiding from you  and your soul of ice My God, I thought you were someone to rely on Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  A girl on a cover but you tore her apart Maybe this year Maybe this year  I'll give it to someone special Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day, you gave it away This year, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day, you gave it away This year, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special And last Christmas And this year It won't be anything like, anything like Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day, you gave it away This year, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special"
Incubus,iwishyouwerehere,"I dig my toes into the sand The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds Strewn across a blue blanket I lean against the wind  Pretend that I am weightless And in this moment I am happy, happy  I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here  I lay my head onto the sand The sky resembles a back-lit canopy With holes punched in it I'm counting UFOs  I signal them with my lighter And in this moment I am happy, happy  I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here Wish you were here  The world's a roller coaster And I am not strapped in Maybe I should hold with care But my hands are busy in the air saying  I wish you were here I wish you were  I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here Wish you were here"
Incubus,tomorrowfood,"I know you vie for the good ol' days and with less of us around, we were a cinch to sway does it feel like it's the end of the world well maybe it is, but when was it not, cause it's true, me and you we are all tomorrow's food today  there's no such thing as the good ol' days the older we all get, the better we all were there's no such as the end of the world (but just in case!) you'd best batten down and button up cause it's true, me and you we are all tomorrow's food today"
Taylor Swift,iwishyouwould,"This is another way I've written songs recently. This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:  Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this  It's 2 am, in your car Windows down, past my street the memories start It's in the past You drive straight ahead You thinking that I hate you now Cause you stll don't know what I never said  I wish you would come back Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I wish you knew that  Do you like it!?"

Taylor Swift,newyearday,"There's glitter on the floor after the party Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor You and me from the night before, but  Don't read the last page But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared And you're turning away I want your midnights But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day  You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi I can tell that it's gonna be a long road I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe Or if you strike out and you're crawling home  Don't read the last page But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong Or we're making mistakes I want your midnights But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day  Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you And I will hold on to you  Please don't ever become a stranger Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere Please don't ever become a stranger Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere  There's glitter on the floor after the party Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor You and me forevermore  Don't read the last page But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong Or we're making mistakes I want your midnights But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day  Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you And I will hold on to you  Please don't ever become a stranger Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere Please don't ever become a stranger Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere"
Taylor Swift,ours,"Elevator buttons and morning air Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares But right now, my time is theirs  Seems like there's always someone who disapproves They'll judge it like they know about me and you And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do The jury's out, but my choice is you  So don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high The water's rough But this love is ours  You never know what people have up their sleeves Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles But I don't care, cause right now you're mine  And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high The waters rough But this love is ours  And it's not theirs to speculate If it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you  Cause I love the gap between your teeth And I love the riddles that you speak And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored Cause my heart is yours  So don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard  So don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine But they can't take what's ours They can't take what's ours The stakes are high The waters rough But this love is ours"
Taylor Swift,idlie,"I don't think that passenger seat Has ever looked this good to me He tells me about his night And I count the colors in his eyes  He'll never fall in love he swears As he runs his fingers through his hair I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong And I don't think it ever crossed his mind He tells a joke I fake a smile That I know all his favorite songs and  I could tell you his favorite colors green He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes And if you ask me if I love him, I'd lie  He looks around the room Innocently overlooks the truth Shouldn't a light go on? Doesn't he know I've had him memorized for so long?  He sees everything black and white Never let nobody see him cry I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine  I could tell you his favorite colors green He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes And if you ask me if I love him, I'd lie  He stands there then walks away My God, if I could only say I'm holding every breathe for you  He'd never tell you but he can play guitar I think he can see through everything but my heart First thought when I wake up is, ""My god, he's beautiful"" So I put on my make up and pray for a miracle  Yes, I could tell you his favorite colors green He loves to argue oh and it kills me His sisters beautiful he has his father's eyes And if you asked me if I love him If you ask me if I love him, I'd lie"
Incubus,imissyou,"To see you when I wake up Is a gift I didn't think could be real To know that you feel the same as I do Is a three-fold, Utopian dream  You do something to me That I can't explain So would I be out of line If I said, ""I miss you""?

Taylor Swift,missinvisible,"There's a girl Who sits under the bleachers Just another day eating alone And though she smiles There is something just hiding And she cant find a way to relate She just goes unnoticed As the crowd passes by And she'll pretend to be busy When inside she just wants to cry She'll say...  Take a little look at the life of Miss Always Invisible Look a little harder, I really really want you to put yourself in her shoes Take another look at the face of Miss Always Invisible Look a little closer and maybe then you will see why she waits for the day When you'll ask her her name  The beginning, in the first weeks of class She did everything to try and fit in But the others they couldn't seem to get past all the things that mismatched on the surface And she would close her eyes when they left and as she fell down the stairs And the more that they joked And the more that they screamed She retreated to where she is now And she'll sing...  Take a little look at the life of Miss Always Invisible Look a little harder I really, really want you to put yourself in her shoes, yeah, yeah Take a little look at the face of Miss Always Invisible Look a little closer and maybe then you will see why she waits for the day that you will ask her name  Then one day, just the same as the last Just, the days been in counting the time Came a boy, that sat under the bleachers just a little bit further behind..."

Stomp the haunted mood in your crown. I used to think about it then I... Chose the word indulgence, now I... Just need some more to stand my own. Why I live this way? Who knows. Why I live this way? He knows. Is this damnation? Or a beginning? I'll take ""B"". To instigate the thought into my. And visualize the blood as the life. Is to bend the wheel of my own kind. I wish you'd see the hope in my eye. All in all sublime on this side. Then again you'd have to leave this life... ....behind. Why I live this way? Who knows. Why I live this way? He knows."

This slope is treacherous, This path is reckless, This slope is treacherous, And I, I, I like it.  I can't decide if it's a choice, Getting swept away.

This slope is treacherous, This path is reckless, This slope is treacherous, I, I, I like it.  Two headlights shine, Through the sleepless night, And I will get you, Will get you alone.  Your name has echoed, Through my mind, And I just think you, should think you should know.  That not being safe is, Worth the driving and I will, Follow you, follow you home, I'll follow you, follow you home.  This hope is treacherous, This daydream is dangerous, This hope is treacherous, I I I, I I I, I I I.  Two headlights shine, Through the sleepless night, And I will get you, Will get you alone.

As outwardly cliche as it may seem Yes, something under the surface says ""C'est la vie"", it is a circle, there is a plan Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again  Look closely at the open wound See past what covers the surface Underneath chaotic catastrophe Creation takes the stage  Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again  Its all been saved With exception for the right parts When will we be new skin?  Its all been seen With the exception for what could be When will we be new skin?

I never thought we'd have our last kiss Never imagined we'd end like this Your name, forever the name on my lips  So I'll watch your life in pictures Like I used to watch you sleep And I feel you forget me, like I used to feel you breathe And I'll keep up with our old friends Just to ask them how you are  Hope it's nice where you are  And I hope the sun shines, and it's a beautiful day And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed You can plan for a change the weather and time But I never planned on you changing your mind  So I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes All that I know is I don't know How to be something you miss  Never thought we'd have our last kiss I never imagined we'd end like this Your name, forever the name on my lips  Just like our last kiss  Forever the name on my lips Forever the name on my lips  Just like our last"

(Ha ha) I can't help it If you look like an angel Can't help it I if I want to Kiss you in the rain so Come feel this magic I've been feeling Since I met you Can't help it if there's no one else I can't help myself If you look like an angel Can't help that I if I want to Kiss you in the rain so Come feel this magic I've been feeling Since I met you Can't help it if there's no one else I can't help myself..."
Incubus,aqueoustransmission,I'm floating down a river Oars freed from their holes long ago Lying face up on the floor of my vessel I marvel at the stars and feel my heart overflow  Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river  Two weeks without my lover I'm in this boat alone Floating down a river named emotion Will I make it back to shore or drift into the unknown  Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river  I'm building an antenna Transmissions will be sent when I am through Maybe we could meet again further down the river And share what we both discovered then revel in the view  Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river  I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river  I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river
